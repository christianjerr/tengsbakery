                    <p class="mt-5">A roll is a small, often round loaf of bread served as a meal accompaniment (eaten plain or with butter).[1] A roll can be served and eaten whole or cut transversely and dressed with filling between the two halves. Rolls are also commonly used to make sandwiches similar to those produced using slices of bread. They are found in most cuisines all over the world. In the Deipnosophistae, the author Athenaeus (c. 170 – c. 230) describes some of the bread, cakes, and pastries available in the Classical world.[2] Among the breads mentioned are griddle cakes, honey-and-oil bread, mushroom-shaped loaves covered in poppy seeds, and the military specialty of rolls baked on a spit.</p><button class="btn btn-success">P 100.00</button></div>

                    <p class="mt-5">is a long, thin loaf of French bread[2] that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape, is defined by French law). It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust.

A baguette has a diameter of about 5 or 6 cm (2-2⅓ in) and a usual length of about 65 cm (26 in), although a baguette can be up to 1 m (39 in) long.</p><button class="btn btn-success">P 200.00</button></div>

                    <p class="mt-5">A bagel (Yiddish: בײגל‎ baygl; Polish: bajgiel), also spelled beigel,[1] is a bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crisp exterior. Bagels are generally eaten untoasted, as they have already been cooked. However some people like them toasted. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types, such as whole-grain or rye.[2][3]</p><button class="btn btn-success">P 50.00</button></div>
